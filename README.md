Welcome, fellow developers and scholars of the digital age! I'm [Gregory M.
Kapfhammer](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/), and I'm thrilled to introduce
you to `pytest-brightest`, a `pytest` plugin designed to illuminate your testing
process. As a professor, researcher, and open-source enthusiast, I've always
been fascinated by the intersection of scientific principles and practical
software development. This plugin is a direct result of that passion, bringing
insights from software testing research right into your command line.

## Why `pytest-brightest`?

In the world of software testing, not all test executions are created equal.
Some tests are long, others are short. Some are prone to failure, while others
are steadfastly reliable. `pytest-brightest` leverages these characteristics to
help you run your test suite in a more intelligent and efficient manner. Whether
you want to get feedback faster, find flaky tests, or simply bring a little more
order to your testing chaos, `pytest-brightest` is here to help.

This plugin is inspired by years of research in software testing, including my
own work on [time-aware test suite
prioritization](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=time-aware+test+suite+prioritization+kapfhammer)
and the broader academic discourse on regression testing and flaky tests.

## Requirements

To use `pytest-brightest`, you'll need:

* `pytest`
* `pytest-json-report`

`pytest-brightest` uses the data generated by `pytest-json-report` to work its
magic. But don't worry, if you have `pytest-json-report` installed,
`pytest-brightest` will automatically configure it for you!

## Modes of Operation

`pytest-brightest` can be enabled with the `--brightest` flag and can operate in
several modes, configured through the `--reorder-by-technique` option.

### Reordering

You can reorder your tests based on a variety of criteria:

*   **`cost`**: Reorders tests based on their execution time from the previous
run. This is perfect for getting quick feedback by running faster tests first.
*   **`name`**: Reorders tests alphabetically by their name.
*   **`failure`**: Reorders tests based on their failure history, running tests
that failed in the previous run first. This is a powerful technique for
regression testing.

### Shuffling

*   **`shuffle`**: Randomizes the order of your tests. This is an excellent way
to uncover hidden dependencies between tests and identify "flaky" tests that
pass or fail based on the order in which they are run.

## Command-Line Arguments

Here's a breakdown of the command-line arguments you can use to control `pytest-brightest`:


| Argument                 | Options                                                              | Default                  | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--brightest`            | (flag)                                                               | `False`                  | Enable the `pytest-brightest` plugin.                                                                   |
| `--reorder-by-technique` | `shuffle`, `name`, `cost`, `failure`                                 | `None`                   | The technique to use for reordering or shuffling tests.                                                 |
| `--reorder-by-focus`     | `modules-within-suite`, `tests-within-module`, `tests-across-modules` | `tests-across-modules`   | The scope of the reordering or shuffling.                                                               |
| `--reorder-in-direction` | `ascending`, `descending`                                            | `ascending`              | The direction of the reordering.                                                                        |
| `--seed`                 | (integer)                                                            | (random)                 | A seed for the random number generator used for shuffling, ensuring reproducible results.               |


### Examples

**Run faster tests first:**

```bash
pytest --brightest --reorder-by-technique cost --reorder-in-direction ascending
```

**Run previously failing tests first:**

```bash
pytest --brightest --reorder-by-technique failure --reorder-in-direction descending
```

**Shuffle all tests with a specific seed:**

```bash
pytest --brightest --reorder-by-technique shuffle --seed 12345
```

**Shuffle tests within each module, but keep the module order:**

```bash
pytest --brightest --reorder-by-technique shuffle --reorder-by-focus tests-within-module
```
